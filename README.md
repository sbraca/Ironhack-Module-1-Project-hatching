# Hatching
First Python Project

It all starts with an sql dataset with the ForbeÂ´s 2018 Billionaires List. 
After the data wrangling process I enriched the data using web scrapping from wikipedia to add:

*Missing Countries.

*The percentage of people with tertiary education in each country. 

It all ends trying to prove there is no relationship between tertiary education and worth.
